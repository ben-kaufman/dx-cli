# WARNING:
#   - It's important to verify always the address of the ERC20 you use for trading
#     anybody can auto-list an ERC20 token in DutchX protocol, so the symbol
#     used in the token is the one that the token creator added, it's not
#     validated by anyone.
#   - Also, note that this also means that there can be several tokens with the
#     same symbol
#   - Add tokens at your own responsability
